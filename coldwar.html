					<h1>The Shift to Main Battle Tanks</h1>
					<p>After World War 2, countries rushed to continue devloping more powerful tanks, with more armor and bigger guns. The philosophy at the time was to have lightly armored, medium armored, and heavily armored tanks for different roles. However, the intense testing and strategizing performed at the start of the Cold War led countries to begin developing, "jack of all trades" tanks. These new MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) generally had similar armor and firepower to the old heavy tanks, with much improved mobility. These MBTs also began to introduce the widespread usage of stabilizers, a key upgrade that allowed tanks to fire accurately while on the move. Listed below are some of the most important early Cold War tanks.</p>

					<h3>T-55</h3>

					<h4>Image via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-54/T-55" target="null">Wikipedia</a></h4>
					<p>The T-55 was accepted into service in the Soviet Union's Red Army in 1958. This tank was the USSR's first main battle tank, and it quickly showed that it outperformed its competitors like the T-54 medium tank and IS-3 heavy tank. It also introduced a stabilizer.  </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Armament: 100mm D-10T rifled gun</li>
						<li>Armor: 100mm at 60° hull, 205mm turret</li>
						<li>Mobility: 51 km/h, 580 hp</li>

					<h3>Centurion</h3>
					<img src="images/centmk3.jpeg" alt="centurion mark 3 tank" class="round">
					<h4>Image via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion_(tank)" target="null">Wikipedia</a></h4>
					<p>The Centurion was initially developed by Britain in 1945, with a few prototypes making their way to Europe before the end of World War II. In 1948, the Centurion Mark 3 was beginning to roll off the production lines. The Mark 3 was ahead of its time and featured many modern systems, including a stabilizer.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Armament: QF 20 pounder tank gun (84mm)</li>
						<li>Armor: 76mm at 58° hull, 152mm turret</li>
						<li>Mobility: 35 km/h, 650 hp</li>

					<h3>M48 Patton</h3>
					<img src="images/m48.jpeg" alt="m48 patton tank" class="round">
					<h4>Image via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M48_Patton" target="null">Wikipedia</a></h4>
					<p>The M48 Patton was developed in 1952 to modernize the old M46 and M47 tanks the United States had in inventory. It was decently armored and included new gun control systems, but unfortunately lacked a stabilizer. Many variants were created to upgrade the Patton throughout its lifespan.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Armament: 90mm M41/T139 gun</li>
						<li>Armor: 110mm at 60° hull, 178mm turret</li>
						<li>Mobility: 48 km/h, 650 hp</li>
					</ul>
